# TeVCat

Scripts for analysis of TeVCat (HESS) sources with the 5-year gamma-ray dataset

plot_hessJ1427.py:  plots the SED of HESS J1427-608, the extrapolated best fit,
    and IceCube's 5-year upper limit

stacking_test.py:  runs the likelihood test of the HESS sources as a stacked catalog

plot_stacking_trials.py:  plots the background trial TS distribution

map_w_srcs.py:  plots simple crosses on top of zoomed in skymap with basemap

plot_HESS_region.py:  plots a rectangular region of the sky centered on the galactic plane
    using healpix, with sources marked with dots and lines to labels of the sources.
