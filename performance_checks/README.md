# event_selection

Scripts testing the performance of reconstruction, event selection, etc.

* ang_res.py
    : Plots the angular resolution vs. energy for different years.

* eff_area_comp.py
    : Plots the effective area to gamma rays vs. energy for each year of detector data

* passing_fraction.py
    : Plots the fraction of events passing the gamma/hadron separation cut as a function of energy

* event_number_count.py
    : Prints the total number events in the final dataset files
