# event_selection

Scripts testing the performance of reconstruction, event selection, etc.

ang_res.py:  Plots the angular resolution vs. energy for different years.
data_mc_check.py:  Plots the gamma-ray probability of a random forest for MC and data to verify agreement
eff_area_comp.py:  Plots the effective area to gamma rays vs. energy for each year of detector data
eff_area_zenith.py:  Plots the effective area vs. zenith angle
gamma_vs_protons_eff_area.py:  Plots effective area vs. energy for gamma-ray and proton MC.
passing_fraction.py:  Plots the fraction of events passing the gamma/hadron separation cut as a function of energy
